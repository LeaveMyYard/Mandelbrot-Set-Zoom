# Mandelbrot Set Zoom
This program is used to render and save frame by frame a zoom animation of the Mandelbrot Set (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set).
Contains two .cpp files and corresponding .exe files. zoom.exe renders frame by frame .png files and saves them. You can use a video renderer to make a .mp4 file, or just use a player.exe to play the rendered animation.

You can see some pictures made by this program down below.
